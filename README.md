# MuralMap
project to connect users to mural around Philadelphia
The city of Philadelphia is a city of murals. The city has nearly 4000 murals
  scattered around the city. The Mural Arts Program is a non-profit that helps
  in creating a maintaining those murals. This app is to help facilitate users and 
  their experience with the city and it's murals using information provided by MAP. 

A user will be able to use this mobile app in order to move around the city and find
  the nearest murals from the users current location. 
  Based off of the mural that is closest to them, recommendations will be given
  for the next 3-5 closest murals. 
  
A user will also be able to see other information about the mural such as: 
  Mural name, Mural Artist, Original creation date,community context or history

A user will be able to filter out murals by artist or theme
  a theme might include "women", "latinx", "black", "LGBT", "sports"
  
The Mural Arts program has predetermined tours that have similarly themed murals
  marked out in a route and a user should be able to see and use those routes 
  as well as add their own to follow. 
  
A user will be able to have a profile to save any created routes as well as a 
  way to save the murals they have already been too.
